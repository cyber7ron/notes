to the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS), which provied a familier and universal layout for all linux users.\n/bin : basic program (ls,cat ,cd ) \n/sbin: system program (fdisk,mkfs,sysctl) \netc  : configuration files \ntmp  : temp files , deleted on boot.\nusr/bin : applications (apt , ncat , nmap ) \nusr/share: applications support and data files. \nBasic linux cmds\nman pages\nlinux cmd lines provides a formal piece of documentation often called manual pages, man cmd is used to view this pages.\napropos\nwith apropos cmd we can search the list of man page description for a possible match based on keyword.\n    apropos partition\nother basic cmd which help to move around linux\ncd : change directory \npwd: present working directory \nls: list directory \nmkdir:make directory\nFinding files in linux\nwe used three common cmd to locate the file in file system.find , locate , which\nwhich\nthe which cmd searches through the directories that are defined in the $PATH env variables.\n    $ which python3\n    /usr/bin/python3\nlocate\nits quickest way to find the loation of files.\nIn order to provide a much shorter search time, locate searches a built-in database named locate.db rather than the entire hard disk.\n    $ locate sbd.exe\n    /usr/share/windows-resources/sbd/sbd.exe\nfind\nits most complex cmd and flexible to search among the three.\nfind /path/to/search \n\n-type : type of file to search . d for directories, f for files. \n-name : name or pattern to search, You can type the whole name, or use wildcards to specify only part(s) of the name. \niname : same as -name but case sensitive. \n-user : search by the owner of files.\n-size : The size of a file is specified with the -size flag. When using numerical values, the formats -n, +n, and n can be used, where n is a number. -n matches values lesser than n, +n matches values greater than n, and n matches values exactly n. To specify a size, you also need a suffix. c is the suffix for bytes, k for KiB’s, and Mfor MiB’s. So, if you want to specify a size less than 30 bytes, the argument -30c should be used.\n-perm : search files by permissions.we can define permission either in octal form (ex. 644) or in symbolic form (ex. u=r)\n-exec : You can use it in your find command to execute a new command, following the -exec flag, like so: -exec whoami \\;\n"},"linux/2_5.html":{"url":"linux/2_5.html","title":"managing linux services","keywords":"","body":"Managing linux services\nssh service\nssh is used to remotely acces your computer,using secure encrypted protocol.\nto start service we use systemctl\n    $ systemctl start ssh\nif we want to enable service on boot up we use enable with systemctl\n    $ systemctl enable ssh\nhttp service\nthe apache http service is often used in pentest for either hosting site, or providing platform to download files to victim machines.\n    $ systemctl start apache2\nto see a table of all available services run systemctl with the list-unit-files\n    $ systemctl list-unit-files\n"},"linux/2_6.html":{"url":"linux/2_6.html","title":"searching, installing, and removing tools","keywords":"","body":"Searching , Installing and removing tools\nAPT is set of tools helps manage pkg on debian based system.\napt update\ninformation regarding to apt is cached locally to speed up any sort of operation which required apt.\nwith the apt update we update the list of pkg , including info related to version,descriptions etc.\napt upgrade \nwe can upgrade installed pkg and core system with latest versioin.\nor we can upgrade single pkg using apt upgrade \napt-cache search\nit displyas information stored in niternal cache pkg database. \nfor example if we want to install pure ftpd first thing we do is find out if pure-ftpd is present in linux repository. to do so we use \n$ apt-cache search pure-ftpd\n\napt-cache search looks for the requested keyword in pkg description rather than the pkg name itself.\napt install\napt install is used to add pkg in system.\n$ apt install \n\napt remove --purge\nit completely remove pkg from system. we can also use apt remove but it will not remove configuration files. --purge used to remove all files with pkg.\n$ apt remove --purge \n\ndpkg\ndpkg is core tool used to install pkg.\n$ dpkg filename.deb\n\n"},"linux/permission_table.html":{"url":"linux/permission_table.html","title":"Permission table","keywords":"","body":"permission table\n\n\n\n\ndigit\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\n1\nThat file can be executed\n\n\n2\nThat file can be written to\n\n\n3\nThat file can be executed and written to\n\n\n4\nThat file can be read\n\n\n5\nThat file can be read and executed\n\n\n6\nThat file can be written to and read\n\n\n7\nThat file can be read, written to, and executed\n\n\n\nu for user, g for group, o for other users not in the group, a for all users.

We can add various type of object ot domain such as computers and user objects. System administrator can organize these objects with the help of Organizational Units(OU) .

For instance take some C code:\n#include \n\nvoid main(void)\n{\n    puts(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n\nThat code isn't ran. Thing is that code is compiled into assembly code, which looks like this:\n0000000000001135 :\n    1135:       55                      push   rbp\n    1136:       48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp\n    1139:       48 8d 3d c4 0e 00 00    lea    rdi,[rip+0xec4]        # 2004 \n    1140:       e8 eb fe ff ff          call   1030 \n    1145:       90                      nop\n    1146:       5d                      pop    rbp\n    1147:       c3                      ret    \n    1148:       0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00    nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]\n    114f:       00\n\nThe purpose of languages like C, is that we can program without having to really deal with assembly code. We write code that is handed to a compiler, and the compiler takes that code and generates assembly code.Then the assembly code is what is actually ran on the processor.\nwith assembly code, there is a lot of different architectures. Different types of processors can run different types of assembly code architectures. The two we are dealing with the most here will be 64 bit, and 32 bit ELF (Executable and Linkable Format). This also called as x64 and x86\nRegister\nRegisters are essentially places that the processor can store memory. You can think of them as buckets which the processor can store information in. Here is a list of the x64 registers, and what their common use cases are.\nrbp: Base Pointer, points to the bottom of the current stack frame\nrsp: Stack Pointer, points to the top of the current stack frame\nrip: Instruction Pointer, points to the instruction to be executed\n\nGeneral Purpose Registers\nThese can be used for a variety of different things\nrax:\nrbx:\nrcx:\nrdx:\nrsi:\nrdi:\nr8:\nr9:\nr10:\nr11:\nr12:\nr13:\nr14:\nr15:\nIn x64 linux arguments to a function are passed via registers.\nrdi:    First Argument\nrsi:    Second Argument\nrdx:    Third Argument\nrcx:    Fourth Argument\nr8:     Fifth Argument\nr9:     Sixth Argument\nwith 86 elf architecture, argument are passed on the stack.\nalso one thing as you may know in C function can return a value.\n In x64, this value is passed in the rax register. In x86 this value is passed in the eaxregister.\n Also one thing, there are different sizes for registers. These typical sizes we will be dealing with are 8 bytes, 4 bytes, 2 bytes, and 1. The reason for these different sizes is due to the advancement of technology, we can store more data in a register.   \n-----------------+---------------+---------------+------------+\n| 8 Byte Register | Lower 4 Bytes | Lower 2 Bytes | Lower Byte |\n+-----------------+---------------+---------------+------------+\n|   rbp           |     ebp       |     bp        |     bpl    |\n|   rsp           |     esp       |     sp        |     spl    |\n|   rip           |     eip       |               |            |\n|   rax           |     eax       |     ax        |     al     |\n|   rbx           |     ebx       |     bx        |     bl     |\n|   rcx           |     ecx       |     cx        |     cl     |\n|   rdx           |     edx       |     dx        |     dl     |\n|   rsi           |     esi       |     si        |     sil    |\n|   rdi           |     edi       |     di        |     dil    |\n|   r8            |     r8d       |     r8w       |     r8b    |\n|   r9            |     r9d       |     r9w       |     r9b    |\n|   r10           |     r10d      |     r10w      |     r10b   |\n|   r11           |     r11d      |     r11w      |     r11b   |\n|   r12           |     r12d      |     r12w      |     r12b   |\n|   r13           |     r13d      |     r13w      |     r13b   |\n|   r14           |     r14d      |     r14w      |     r14b   |\n|   r15           |     r15d      |     r15w      |     r15b   |\n+-----------------+---------------+---------------+------------+\nIn x64 we will see the 8 byte registers. However in x86 the largest sized registers we can use are the 4 byte registers like ebp, esp, eip etc. Now we can also use smaller registers, than the maximum sized registers for the architecture.\nIn x64 there is the rax, eax, ax, and al register. The rax register points to the full 8. The eax register is just the lower four bytes of the rax register. The ax register is the last 2 bytes of the rax register. Lastly the al register is the last byte of the rax register.\nwords\nword is just two byte data. \ndword is four byte of data \nqword is eight byte of data.\n\n\n\ndata tyep\nsuffix\nsize\n\n\n\n\nbytes\nb\n1\n\n\nword\nw\n2\n\n\nDouble word\nl\n4\n\n\nQuad word\nq\n8\n\n\nsingle precision\ns\n4\n\n\nDouble precision\nl\n8\n\n\n\nstack\nstack is LIFO data structure and its where local variables in the code are stored. we can add or remove value from stack by either pushing them or popping them.\nrbp : points to the bottom of the stack. \nrsp : points to the top of the stack.\nFlags\nthere is one register that contains flags. A flag is particular bit of this register.\n00:     Carry Flag\n01:     always 1\n02:     Parity Flag\n03:     always 0\n04:     Adjust Flag\n05:     always 0\n06:     Zero Flag\n07:     Sign Flag\n08:     Trap Flag\n09:     Interruption Flag     \n10:     Direction Flag\n11:     Overflow Flag\n12:     I/O Privilege Field lower bit\n13:     I/O Privilege Field higher bit\n14:     Nested Task Flag\n15:     Resume Flag\nInstructions\nmov : mov data to one register to another\nmov rax, rdx\n\ndereference : \nIf you ever see brackets like [], they are meant to dereference, which deals with pointers. A pointer is a value that points to a particular memory address (it is a memory address). Dereferencing a pointer means to treat a pointer like the value it points to. For instance:\nmov rax, [rdx]\n\n# will move the value pointed to by rdx into the rax register.\n\nmov [rax], rdx \n\n# Will move the value of the rdx register into whatever memory is pointed to by the rax register. The actual value of the rax register does not change.\nlea : \nThe lea instruction calculates the address of the second operand, and moves that address in the first. For instance:\nlea rdi, [rbx+0x10]\n\n# This will move the address rbx+0x10 into the rdi register.\n\nadd : \nadds two values together, and stores the sum in the first arguments.\nadd rax, rdx\n\n# that will set rax equal to rax + rdx\n\nsub : subtract the second operand from first and store result in first argument.\nsub rsp, 0x10\n\n# this will set rsp register equal to rsp - 0x10\n\nxor : this will perform binary operation xor on the two arguments its given, and stores the result in the first operation.\nxor rdx, rax\n\nThat will set the rdx register equal to rdx ^ rax.\nThe and and or operations essentially do the same thing, except with the and or or binary operators.\npush : it will push the content of a register into stack.\npush rax\npop : it will pop the content of the stack\npop rax\n\njmp : The jmp instruction will jump to an instruction address. It is used to redirect code execution. \njmp 0x602010\n\ncall & ret : \nThis is similar to the jmp instruction. The difference is it will push the values of rbp and rip onto the stack, then jump to whatever address it is given. This is used for calling functions. After the function is finished, a ret instruction is called which uses the pushed values of rbp and rip (saved base and instruction pointers) it can continue execution right where it left off\njnz / jz\nits similar to jump instruction , the diffrence here is it jump if specific flag is set. jnz : jump if not zero. jz jump if zero\nsome other important instruction\nleaq source, destination : this instruction sets destination to the address denoted by the expression in source\naddq source, destination: destination = destination + source\nsubq source, destination: destination = destination - source\nimulq source, destination: destination = destination * source\nsalq source, destination: destination = destination \nsarq source, destination: destination = destination >> source where >> is the right bit shifting operator\nxorq source, destination: destination = destination XOR source\nandq source, destination: destination = destination & source\norq source, destination: destination = destination | source\n\nconditional jump\nIf some specified condition is satisfied in conditional jump, the control flow is transferred to a target instruction.\nFollowing are the conditional jump instructions used on signed data used for arithmetic operations −\n\n\n\nInstruction\nDescription\nFlags tested\n\n\n\n\nJE/JZ\nJump Equal or Jump Zero\nZF\n\n\nJNE/JNZ\nJump not Equal or Jump Not Zero\nZF\n\n\nJG/JNLE\nJump Greater or Jump Not Less/Equal\nOF, SF, ZF\n\n\nJGE/JNL\nJump Greater/Equal or Jump Not Less\nOF, SF\n\n\nJL/JNGE\nJump Less or Jump Not Greater/Equal\nOF, SF\n\n\nJLE/JNG\nJump Less/Equal or Jump Not Greater\nOF, SF, ZF\n\n\n\nFollowing are the conditional jump instructions used on unsigned data used for logical operations −\n\n\n\nInstruction\nDescription\nFlags tested \n\n\n\n\nJE/JZ\nJump Equal or Jump Zero\nZF\n\n\nJNE/JNZ\nJump not Equal or Jump Not Zero\nZF\n\n\nJA/JNBE\nJump Above or Jump Not Below/Equal\nCF, ZF\n\n\nJAE/JNB\nJump Above/Equal or Jump Not Below\nCF\n\n\nJB/JNAE\nJump Below or Jump Not Above/Equal\nCF\n\n\nJBE/JNA\nJump Below/Equal or Jump Not Above\nAF, CF\n\n\n\nThe following conditional jump instructions have special uses and check the value of flags −\n\n\n\nInstruction\nDescription\nFlags tested\n\n\n\n\nJXCZ\nJump if CX is Zero\nnone\n\n\nJC\nJump If Carry\nCF\n\n\nJNC\nJump If No Carry\nCF\n\n\nJO\nJump If Overflow\nOF\n\n\nJNO\nJump If No Overflow\nOF\n\n\nJP/JPE\nJump Parity or Jump Parity Even\nPF\n\n\nJNP/JPO\nJump No Parity or Jump Parity Odd\nPF\n\n\nJS\nJump Sign (negative value)\nSF\n\n\nJNS\nJump No Sign (positive value)\nSF\n\n\n\n"},"bin_exp/intro/radare2.html":{"url":"bin_exp/intro/radare2.html","title":"1.2 Radare2","keywords":"","body":"radare2\nCommon r2 flags options :\n-A : analyze the binary upon entering the r2 console.\n-d : enable the debugger\n-w : open file in write mod\n- : enter console without opening a file.\nAnalyzation\nGenerally all analyzation commands start with the letter a.

For example a? would output ab,aa,ac along with a description on what each command does.\naaa : ananlyze everything\naf : analyze function\nafl : list of functions\ninformation\ni is a command that shows general information of the binary. Like a it has many sub commands each with varying degrees of specificity.\nia : show all info about file\nizz : show every string in binary\niM : address main funciton\nj : if added in end of every cmd , get json output format.\nie : get entrypoint of the file\nNavigation\ns : print current memory address\ns addrs : go to specific point in memory\ns+ 5 : go 5 bytes forward\ns- 12 : go 12 byte backward\ns- : undo previous seek\ns main : go to address of main function\nsr rax : go to the address of the rax register.\nPrinting\np is a command that shows data in a myriad of formats. The command is useful for when you want to get information about what is happening in memory, and get some of the data that's contained in memory as well. \nWith the p command it is also useful to know about the @ symbol in radare. The @ symbol is used to specify that something is an address in memory, for example if you wanted to specify you were talking about the memory address of the main function you would use @main\npx : print hex output of where you currently are in memory.\npd : print the diassembly of current memory.\npd @ main : disassemble main function.\npxe : print emoji hexdump\npC : disassemble in column format\npdf @functin_name : disaasemble function\nDebugging\nDebug mode allows you to set breakpoints and offers a lot of options to not only navigate through your binary, but to analyze the data that goes in and out of the registers as well.\ndb : set a breakpoint\ndr : print out values of all registers.\ndc : run program until it ends or hit next breakpoint.\nds : step throught the binary one line at a time.\nds 2 : go forth 2 lines in binary.\ndbi : list out indexes and memory addresses of all breakpoints.\nVisual Mode\nallows the assembly to more human readable and provides a lot of options to enhance the visual appeal of radare and can definitely improve efficiency.

For example take this code\nint val = 4;\nif(val ==5){\n    printf(\"%s\",\"You win!\");\n}\n\nYou will never be able to get it to print out You win! because under normal circumstances val will never be set equal to 5.
