# 1. Intro to Active Directory

![active dir structure](img/activi_dir.png)

Active Directory consiste several component , the most imp component is `domain controller(DC)`. The `DC` is hub and core of active directory because it stored all information about how the specific instance is configure in active directory. it also configure what services and tools are available to end users.

when an instace of active direcotry is configured, a domain is created with a name such as `corp.com` where corp is name of organization. We can add various type of object ot domain such as computers and user objects. System administrator can organize these objects with the help of `Organizational Units(OU)` . We can compare OU to file system folders in that they are containers used to store and group other objects. Computer objects represent servers and workstations which is part of domain, and user object represent employee in the organization. This AD objects contain attributes which vary according to the type of object. For example user object can have first name,last name, password, username attributes.

Typically client computer on an internal network are connected to the domain controller and to varioius other internal member servers such as database server, file storage server etc. In addtion many organizations provide content throught internet connected web server , which sometimes are also members of the internal domain.

*Schema* : Defines objects and their attributes

*Query and index mechanism* : provides searching and publication of objects and their properties.

*Global Catalog* : Contains informaiton about every object in the directory.

*Replication Service* : Distributes information across domain controllers.

**Active directory structure**

forests, domain and organizations units (OUs) are the basic building blocks of any active directory structure.

*Forest*

forest may contain multiple domains and each domain may contain multiple OUs.

**Powershell**

* provide access to almost everything in windows platform and active directory environment which could be useful for attacker.

* provide capabilities of running powerfull scripts completely from memory.

* based on .NET framework.

1. `Get-Help` : List everything about the help topics. 
2. `Get-Help process` : Lists everything which contains the world process.
3. `Update-Help` : Update the help system.
