# Method of Detecting malicious code

*Portable Executable file* :

The Portable Executabl file(PE) file format used on windows os for executable and objects file. the PE format represt the windows data structure, that defined detailed information necessary for the windows loader, to manage the wrapped executable code including dynamic libraries and API imports and exports tables etc.

**The techniques used by AV manufactures to detect malicious code**

* Signature based Detection :

An AV signature is continues sequence of bytes within malware that uniquely identifes it. in this techniques the file system is scanned for know malware signature and if any are detected, the offending file are quarantined.

since differen AV vendor use different signature and proprietary technologies to detect malware and each vendor update AV constantly , its difficult to come up with a catch-all AV solution. for this reason we must identify presence, type and version of antivirus sw on target and consider bypass strategy.

* Heuristic and Behavioral-Based Detection

this method relies on various rules and algorithm to determine whether or not an action is consider malicious.this is achieved by stepping through the instructions set of binary or decomile and analyze the source code.

alternatively this method dynamically analyze the behavious of a binary file.this is achieved by executing binary file in question in an emulated environment such as small virtual machine etc.
