with the `apt update` we update the list of pkg , including info related to version,descriptions etc.

or we can upgrade single pkg using `apt upgrade <pkg_name>`

**apt-cache search**

it displyas information stored in niternal cache pkg database. <br>

for example if we want to install pure ftpd first thing we do is find out if pure-ftpd is present in linux repository. to do so we use 
	
```bash
$ apt-cache search pure-ftpd
```

*apt-cache search looks for the requested keyword in pkg description rather than the pkg name itself.*
