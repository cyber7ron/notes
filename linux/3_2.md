# piping and redirection

## piping

piping is used to redirect the output of one cmd to input of another cmd

		cat etc/passed | wc -c  


## Redirection

every cmd run in terminal have three data streams.
1. stdin
2. stdout
3. stderr

**stdin**

we use stdin to feed data to program from file.

		$ cat < file.txt

**stdout**

we use `>` for redirect the program output to file, and keep it for future use.
```bash
$ ls > filelist.txt
```
to append additional data to an existing file we use `>>` operator.

**redirecting stderr**

the file descriptor for stdin , stdout and stderr are 0,1,2 respectively.this number is use to manipulate the corresponding data streams from cmd line.
		
```
$ cat nofile.txt 2>error.txt
```
