# Comparing Files

**comm**

it compare two files text file and display the lines that are unique to each other as well as lines that are common. it output three space-offset columns. 

first column contains lines that are unique to the first file or argument. <br>
second columns contains lines that are unique to the second file or argument <br>
third columns contains lines that are present in both files.

```bash
$ comm file1.txt file2.txt
```

the switch `-n` where n can be 1,2 or 3 can be used to suppress one or more columns depending on need.
```bash
$ comm -12 file1.txt file2.txt
```
`-12` did not show 1 and 2 columns , it only show lines that are found in both files.

**diff**

the `diff` cmd is used to detect difference between two files like `comm` cmd but `diff` is more complex and support many output format

```bash
$ diff filea.txt fileb.txt
```
**vimdiff**

`vimdiff` opens vim with multiple file , one in each window.the diffrence between files is highlighted which makes it easier to visually inspec them.

`dp` : puts the changes from current window to other one.
`]c` : jumps to the next change
`[c` : jumps to privious change.
`ctrl + w` : switch to other split window.
