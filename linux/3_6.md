# Managing Processes

process is assigned a number called a process ID(PID).

**jobs**

linux shell introduce a concept called *jobs* to ease the users workflow during terminal session. for example `cat error.txt | wc -m ` is a pipeline of two process which shell consider as a single jobs.<br>

job control the refers to the ability to selectively suspend the execution of jobs and resume their execution at a later time.

**background process (bg)** 

the quickest way to background a process is to append an ampersand `&` to the end of the cmd to send it to bakcground.
```bash
$ ping google.com &
```
if process is running then we use `ctrl + z`.

**job control : jobs and fg**

`jobs` is utility that list the process that we send to background.<br>
`fg` return background process to foreground.

```bash
$ ping google.com
^Z 

$ ping facebook.com
^Z

$ jobs
[1]-  Stopped                 ping google.com
[2]+  Stopped                 ping facebook.com

$ fg %2
ping facebook.com
```


**process control : ps and kill**

to monitor process in linux system we use `ps` cmd. `ps` list all processes that are running , not only for current terminal like `jobs`.

two important switches for `ps`:

`-e` : select all process
`-f` : display full format listing(UID,PID,PPID,etc)

we use `kill` to terminate process using PID of process.

```bash
kill 1337
```
