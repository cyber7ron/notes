# Intro to Bash Scripting

A bash script plain text file contains series of cmds that are executed as if they had been typed at a terminal prompt.<br>
the `chmod` cmd along with `+x` options used to make bash script executable, and `./script_name` to actually run it.

```bash

#!/bin/bash
# here is comment

echo "hello world"

```

in this script :

`#!` is commonly know as shebang and its ignore by interpreter.<br>
`/bin/bash` its absolute path to interpreter, which used to run script.<br>
`#` its used to declare comment and it is ignore by interpreter.
