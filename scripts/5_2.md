# Variables

variables are named places to temp store data. we can declare variable as
```bash
$ var_name=var_value
```

to reference declare variable we use `$` 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name = john
echo  $name
john 
```

we can also set the output of cmd to value of variable, this is know as *cmd substitution* which allow use to take the output of cmd or program and have it saved as the value of variable.
```bash
user=$(whoami)
echo $user
kali
```

**arguments**

we can supply cmd line argument and use them in our scripts.

```bash
kali@kali:-$ cat arg.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "the first two argument are $1 and $2"

kali@kali:-$ ./arg.sh hello there
the first tow argument are hello and there.

```

*example of few bash variables:*

Variables name | Description
---------------|-----------
$0 | the name of bash script
$1 - $9 | the first 9 arg of script
$# | number of argument passed to script
$@ | all arg passed to the bash script
$? | exist status of most recently run process
$$ | process id of current script
$USER | the username of the user running the script
$HOSTNAME | hostname of machine
$RANDOM |  a random number
$LINENO | the current line number in the script



**Reading the input**

we can also capture interactive user input while script is running with `read` cmd. `read` cmd mostly used with two switches `-p` which allows us to specify a prompt , and `-s` which makes the user input silent.
