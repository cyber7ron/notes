-n STRING | STRING length is greater than zero
-z STRING | the length of STRING is zero (empty)
STRING1 != STRING2 | STRING1 is not equal to STRING2
STRING1 = STRING2 | STRING1 is equal to STRING2
INT1 -eg INT2 | INT1 is equal to INT2
-ne | not equal to (int)
-gt | greater than (int)
-lt | less than (int)
-ge | greater than equal to (int)
-le | less than equal to (int)
-d FILE | FILE exists and is a directory
