# Boolean Logical Operations

Boolean logical operators execute cmd based on whether a previous cmd succeede or not.

`&& (AND)` : AND operator only execute cmd if the previous cmd is succeds (or return true or 0).

*example*

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep kali && echo "user found"
kali:x:1000:1000:Kali,,,:/home/kali:/bin/bash
user found
```
`|| (OR)`  : OR operator is oppsite of AND operator , it execute next cmd if previous one is failed.(return false or non-zero)

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep nouser || echo "user not found"
user not found
```

we mostly use `AND` , `OR` operator with `if` statement.
