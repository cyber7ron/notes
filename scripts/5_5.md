# Loops

loops help us with repetitive tasks that we need to run until certain criteria met.

**for loops**

`for` loop is used to perform a given set of cmds for each of the items in a list,below is the general syntax of `for` loop:

*syntax*

```bash
for var_name in <list>
do
	//here perform this action
done
```
the for loop take each item in list in order, assign that item as the value of the variable `var_name`, and perform the given action between do and done, then go back to top , grab the next item in list and repeat this until the list is exhausted.


*seq cmdis use to print a sequence of number*

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10)
do
	echo "the number is " $i
done
```
the output will be 
```
the number is  1
the number is  2
the number is  3
the number is  4
the number is  5
the number is  6
the number is  7
the number is  8
the number is  9
the number is  10
```

**while loop**

while loop executes code until the expression is true.

*syntax*
```bash
while [ <some condition> ]
do
	//perform this action
done
```
