# Functions

in a bash scripting we can think of function as a script inside script. it is usefull when we need to use  same code multiple time, instead of writing same code again and again we can create function and when we need it we can call it by its name.

*syntax*
```bash
func_name() {
	block of code
}
```
anothe way to define function is
```bash
function fun_name {
	block of code 
}
```

*example of function*

```bash
printhello(){
	echo "this is function for print hello"
}
//calling function
printhello
```

*function can also accept arguments*

```bash
randomnum() {
	echo "this function print random number"
	echo "the random number is :" $1
}
randomnum $RANDOM
``` 

**scope of varibles**

The scope of variable is simply the context in which it has meaning. By default a vaiable has `global scope` maeaning it can be accessed throughtout the entire script. In contrast , a local variables can only be seen within the function or block of code. in which it is defiend.<br>
	we can also *overlay* a global function , by giving a local context, by precending the declaration with the local keyword, leaving global variable untouched . eg: `local name="joe"`

*lets see how local and global variables work in practice with a simple example*

```bash
name1 = "john"
name2 = "jason"

name_change() {
	local name1="edword"
	echo "inside this function , name1 is $name1 and name2 is $name2"
	name2="Lucas"
}
echo "Before the function call , name1 is $name1 and name2 is $name2"

name_change

echo "after the function call, name1 is $name1 and name2 is $name2"
```

*output of function*

```
Before function call, name1 is john and name2 is json
inside this funciton, name1 is edword and name2 is json
after the function call, name1 is john and name2 is lucas
